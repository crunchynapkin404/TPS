# TPS Application - Inconsistency Resolution Summary

## 🎯 Problem Solved

The TPS application had numerous inconsistencies across its page layouts, styling, and functionality that created a confusing user experience. Through comprehensive analysis and systematic fixes, we've consolidated these into a unified, professional interface.

## ✅ Major Changes Implemented

### 1. **Unified Calendar System**
- **Created**: `frontend/templates/pages/calendar_unified.html` - A single, comprehensive calendar view
- **Features**:
  - Consistent Tailwind CSS styling with TPS brand colors

  - Responsive calendar grid with Monday-first European layout
  - Comprehensive test data generation for realistic previews
  - Proper timezone handling (Europe/Amsterdam)
  - Event color coding by assignment type

### 2. **Eliminated Inconsistencies**
- **Moved to Legacy**: 5 inconsistent calendar files to `legacy_files/` folder:
  - `calendar_demo.html` - Polished standalone version
  - `calendar_test.html` - Basic test version
