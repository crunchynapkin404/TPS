# TPS V1.4 Actual Codebase Analysis

## Step 1: Request for Systematic Analysis

To provide you with a real, sensible evaluation instead of assumptions, I need to analyze your codebase systematically. Let me examine specific files to understand:

1. **Current UI/UX Implementation**
2. **Actual Role Implementation** 
3. **Existing Features vs Requirements**
4. **Real Code Quality Issues**

## What I Need to Analyze

### Frontend Structure Analysis Needed:
```
Can you show me the content of these key files:
1. frontend/templates/base.html - to see the overall layout
2. frontend/templates/dashboard/index.html - to see current dashboard
3. frontend/static/js/app.js - to understand initialization
4. frontend/static/css/style.css - to see current styling
5. frontend/templates/includes/menu.html - to see navigation structure
```

### Component Analysis Needed:
```
Show me the actual implementation of:
1. frontend/static/js/components/calendar.js
2. frontend/static/js/components/team-switcher.js
3. frontend/static/js/components/planning-wizard.js
4. frontend/static/js/components/shift-assignment.js
```

### Backend Analysis Needed:
```
I need to see:
1. apps/users/models.py - to check if roles exist
2. apps/teams/models.py - to understand team structure
3. apps/shifts/models.py - to see shift implementation
4. apps/planning/models.py - to understand planning data
5. apps/shifts/views.py - to see current endpoints
```

### API Structure Analysis:
```
Show me:
1. api/v1/teams_enhanced.py - first 50 lines
2. api/v1/analytics.py - first 50 lines
3. The main urls.py file
4. Any API documentation files
```

## Current Understanding (What I Can See)

From the file structure alone, I can see:
- You have both `/frontend/static/` and `/staticfiles/` directories (potential duplication)
- Multiple analytics files (analytics.py, analytics_overview.py)
- Multiple team files (teams_enhanced.py, teams_overview.py)
- A planning orchestrator system exists
- WebSocket consumers are present

But without seeing the actual code content, I cannot:
- Determine if roles are implemented
- See what UI/UX issues exist
- Understand the actual functionality gaps
- Identify real code quality problems

## Proper Analysis Approach

Instead of making assumptions, let's analyze:

### 1. Current Feature Inventory
I need to check what actually exists:
- [ ] User authentication system
- [ ] Role/permission system
- [ ] Team management
- [ ] Shift assignment
- [ ] Leave requests
- [ ] Shift swaps
- [ ] Planning automation
- [ ] Analytics/reporting
- [ ] Real-time updates

### 2. UI/UX Current State
I need to examine:
- [ ] Current page layouts
- [ ] Navigation structure
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Component consistency
- [ ] User workflows
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Loading states
- [ ] Empty states

### 3. Role-Based Functionality Check
Need to verify if these exist:
- [ ] Different dashboards per role
- [ ] Menu items filtered by role
- [ ] API permissions by role
- [ ] UI components that adapt to role

### 4. Missing Features Verification
Confirm what's actually missing:
- [ ] Today's view for users
- [ ] Multi-team management for planners
- [ ] Analytics for managers
- [ ] Leave request workflow
- [ ] Shift swap workflow
- [ ] Automated planning triggers
