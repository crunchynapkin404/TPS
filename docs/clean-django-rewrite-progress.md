# TPS V1.4 Clean Django Rewrite - Progress Log

## Overview
Complete rewrite of TPS models to eliminate anti-Django patterns and implement proper Django relationships.

**Start Date:** Current Session  
**Strategy:** Phase-by-phase replacement of JSONField abuse with proper Django models  
**Goal:** Clean, maintainable Django implementation with proper relationships  

## Anti-Django Patterns Identified
1. **JSONField Abuse**: Using JSONField for data that should be relational
2. **Hard-coded Choices**: Status/priority as strings instead of extensible models
3. **Missing Relationships**: No proper ForeignKey relationships between models
4. **Custom Field Patterns**: Complex custom fields instead of Django standards

## Clean Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Models ✅ COMPLETE
**Location:** `core/models/foundation.py`
**Purpose:** Create extensible base models for status, priority, skills, and categories

**Completed Models:**
- ✅ `Status` - Replaces hard-coded STATUS_CHOICES
- ✅ `Priority` - Replaces hard-coded PRIORITY_CHOICES  
- ✅ `SkillCategory` - Hierarchical skill organization
- ✅ `Skill` - Individual skills with categories and requirements
- ✅ `ShiftCategory` - Shift type organization

**Key Improvements:**
- Extensible status/priority system (no more hard-coded choices)
- Proper hierarchical relationships for skills
- Audit fields on all models
- Database indexes for performance
- Clean validation methods

### Phase 2: User Management ✅ COMPLETE
**Location:** `apps/accounts/models.py`
**Purpose:** Clean user models with proper relationships (no JSONField abuse)

**Completed Models:**
- ✅ `User` - Clean AbstractUser extension with proper fields
- ✅ `UserYearStats` - YTD statistics (separated from JSONField)
- ✅ `UserSkill` - User-skill relationships with proficiency levels
- ✅ `UserShiftPreference` - Detailed shift preferences (no JSON)
- ✅ `UserBlackoutDate` - Availability blackouts with proper validation
- ✅ `UserAvailability` - Weekly availability patterns

**Key Improvements:**
- Separated JSONField data into proper related models
- Proper ForeignKey relationships to core models
- Validation methods for date/time ranges
- Proper choice fields instead of free text
- Database indexes for common queries

### Phase 3: Team Management ✅ COMPLETE
**Location:** `apps/teams/models.py`
**Purpose:** Team structure with proper relationships

**Completed Models:**
- ✅ `Team` - Clean team model with status/priority relationships
- ✅ `TeamRole` - Extensible roles (no hard-coded choices)
- ✅ `TeamMembership` - User-team relationships with proper status
- ✅ `TeamShiftCategory` - Team specializations in shift types
- ✅ `TeamSkillRequirement` - Required skills per team (no JSONField)
- ✅ `TeamNotificationPreference` - Notification settings (no JSONField)
- ✅ `TeamSchedulePattern` - Schedule templates (no JSONField)
- ✅ `TeamSchedulePatternDay` - Pattern details (replacing JSON structure)

**Key Improvements:**
- Eliminated `notification_preferences` JSONField → proper `TeamNotificationPreference` model
- Eliminated `pattern_data` JSONField → structured `TeamSchedulePattern` and `TeamSchedulePatternDay` models
- Replaced hard-coded role choices with extensible `TeamRole` model
- Added proper skill requirements tracking via `TeamSkillRequirement`
- Integrated with foundation Status/Priority models
- Added team specialization tracking via `TeamShiftCategory`

### Phase 4: Planning & Scheduling ✅ COMPLETE
**Location:** `apps/scheduling/models.py`
**Purpose:** Shift planning and assignment with clean relationships

**Completed Models:**
- ✅ `ShiftTemplate` - Clean shift templates (no JSONField abuse)
- ✅ `ShiftTemplateDayOfWeek` - Days of week config (replacing JSONField)
- ✅ `ShiftTemplateSkillRequirement` - Skill requirements (replacing JSONField)
- ✅ `ShiftInstance` - Individual shift occurrences with proper status
- ✅ `ShiftAssignment` - Clean assignment tracking
- ✅ `PlanningPeriod` - Planning cycles with proper team relationships
- ✅ `PlanningPeriodTeam` - Team participation in planning periods
- ✅ `PlanningAlgorithm` - Extensible planning algorithms

**Key Improvements:**
- Eliminated `days_of_week` JSONField → proper `ShiftTemplateDayOfWeek` model
- Eliminated `required_skills` JSONField → structured `ShiftTemplateSkillRequirement` model
- Replaced hard-coded status choices with Status model relationships
- Added missing team relationships to `PlanningPeriod` via `PlanningPeriodTeam`
- Made planning algorithms extensible via `PlanningAlgorithm` model
- Integrated with foundation Status/Priority models throughout

### Phase 5: Advanced Features ✅ COMPLETE
**Location:** `apps/scheduling/models.py` (consolidated)
**Purpose:** Assignment history, swap requests, and coverage

**Completed Models:**
- ✅ `ShiftAssignmentHistory` - Clean audit trail for assignment changes
- ✅ `ShiftSwapRequest` - Shift swap functionality with proper workflow
- ✅ `ShiftCoverageRequest` - Coverage requests when assignments can't be fulfilled

**Key Improvements:**
- Eliminated `metadata` JSONField in assignment history → structured fields
- Replaced hard-coded status choices with Status model relationships
- Added proper approval workflow for swap requests
- Integrated coverage request functionality
- Consolidated assignment-related models into scheduling app

## Implementation Notes

### Database Strategy
- **No Data Migration**: Fresh implementation, no legacy data preservation
- **Clean Migrations**: New migration files for all rewritten models
- **Index Optimization**: Proper indexes on commonly queried fields

### Validation Strategy
- **Model-level Validation**: Clean methods on all models
- **Business Logic**: Proper constraint enforcement
- **User-friendly Errors**: Clear validation messages

### Testing Strategy
- **Model Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests for all models
- **Relationship Tests**: Verify all ForeignKey relationships
- **Business Logic Tests**: Test all validation and business rules

## Current Status Summary

### ✅ COMPLETE - All Major Anti-Django Patterns Eliminated

**Core Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Foundation models (Status, Priority, Skills, Categories)
- ✅ User management with proper relationships
- ✅ Team structure with extensible roles
- ✅ Scheduling system with clean templates
- ✅ Assignment tracking with audit trails
- ✅ Swap and coverage request functionality

**Anti-Django Patterns Eliminated:**
- ❌ JSONField abuse → ✅ Proper relational models
- ❌ Hard-coded choices → ✅ Extensible model-based choices
- ❌ Missing relationships → ✅ Comprehensive ForeignKey structure
- ❌ Custom field patterns → ✅ Standard Django patterns

## Implementation Summary

The TPS V1.4 clean Django rewrite is **COMPLETE** for all major models. The system now follows proper Django conventions with:

1. **Extensible Foundation**: Status, Priority, and Skill systems can be extended without code changes
2. **Proper Relationships**: All data relationships use ForeignKey/ManyToMany instead of JSONField
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete history tracking for all assignment changes
4. **Team Integration**: Proper team relationships throughout the planning system
5. **Clean Validation**: Model-level validation with clear error messages

The rewrite successfully transforms an anti-Django implementation into a clean, maintainable, and extensible Django application.

## Code Quality Improvements

### Before (Anti-Django Patterns)
```python
# Hard-coded choices
STATUS_CHOICES = [('active', 'Active'), ...]

# JSONField abuse  
user_skills = models.JSONField(default=dict)
preferences = models.JSONField(default=dict)
```

### After (Clean Django)
```python
# Extensible models
status = models.ForeignKey(Status, on_delete=models.PROTECT)

# Proper relationships
user_skills = models.ForeignKey(UserSkill, related_name='user_skills')
```

## Next Session Goals
1. **Generate Migrations**: Create clean migrations for all rewritten models
2. **Populate Foundation Data**: Create initial Status, Priority, Skill, and Algorithm records
3. **Service Layer Updates**: Update business logic services to use new relationships
4. **Test Alignment**: Update test suite to work with clean model structure
5. **Performance Optimization**: Add any missing database indexes
