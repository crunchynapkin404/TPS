    ('MANAGER', 'Manager'),     # Full system access
]
role = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=ROLE_CHOICES, default='USER')

# Helper Methods
def is_planner(self): return self.role in ['PLANNER', 'MANAGER']
def is_manager(self): return self.role == 'MANAGER'  
def can_access_planning(self): return self.role in ['PLANNER', 'MANAGER']
```
