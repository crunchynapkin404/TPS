# TPS Performance Optimization Report

## Overview
This report documents the performance optimizations implemented in the TPS (Team Planning System) repository to address identified bottlenecks and improve system performance.

## Identified Performance Issues

### 1. Database Query Problems (High Priority)

**N+1 Query Issues:**
- `ManagerDashboardStrategy._get_team_stats()` - Making individual queries for each team
- `PlannerDashboardStrategy._generate_planning_advice()` - Looping through teams with separate queries
- `LeaveOverviewView.get_context_data()` - Multiple separate queries for statistics

**Missing Query Optimizations:**
- Lack of `select_related` and `prefetch_related` in dashboard queries  
- No database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Separate queries that could be combined into single aggregated queries

### 2. Caching Issues (High Priority)

**No Caching Layer:**
- User permissions recalculated on every request
- Dashboard data regenerated for each page load
- Team memberships queried repeatedly
- System statistics calculated fresh each time

### 3. Inefficient Algorithms (Medium Priority)

**Repeated Calculations:**
- Role-based permission checks executed multiple times per request
- Team statistics calculated individually rather than in batch
- Complex dashboard context built from scratch each time

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Database Query Optimizations

#### Fixed N+1 Query Problems

**ManagerDashboardStrategy._get_team_stats():**
```python
# BEFORE: N+1 queries (1 per team)
for team in managed_teams:
    team_members = User.objects.filter(team_memberships__team=team).count()
    this_week_assignments = Assignment.objects.filter(...).count()

# AFTER: 2 optimized queries with annotations
team_member_counts = managed_teams.annotate(
    member_count=Count('memberships', filter=Q(...))
)
team_assignment_counts = Assignment.objects.filter(...).values(...).annotate(
    assignment_count=Count('id')
)
```

**PlannerDashboardStrategy._generate_planning_advice():**
```python
# BEFORE: N queries (1 per team)
for team in user_teams:
    upcoming_shifts = ShiftInstance.objects.filter(...).count()

# AFTER: 1 query with aggregation
team_unassigned_counts = ShiftInstance.objects.filter(...).values(...).annotate(
    unassigned_count=Count('id')
)
```

#### Enhanced Query Optimizations

**LeaveOverviewView.get_context_data():**
```python
# BEFORE: 5+ separate queries
stats = {
    'total_requests': self.get_queryset().count(),
    'pending_requests': self.get_queryset().filter(...).count(),
    'approved_requests': self.get_queryset().filter(...).count(),
    'used_days_ytd': leave_balances.aggregate(total=Sum('used'))['total'],
    'pending_days': leave_balances.aggregate(total=Sum('pending'))['total'],
}

# AFTER: 2 optimized aggregate queries
request_stats = base_queryset.aggregate(
    total_requests=Count('id'),
    pending_requests=Count('id', filter=Q(...)),
    approved_requests=Count('id', filter=Q(...))
)
balance_stats = leave_balances.aggregate(
    used_days_ytd=Sum('used'),
    pending_days=Sum('pending')
)
```

#### Added Database Indexes

Created migration `0005_performance_indexes.py` with strategic indexes:
- `idx_user_role` on `tps_users.role`
- `idx_assignment_status` on `tps_assignments.status`  
- `idx_assignment_user_status` on `(user_id, status)`
- `idx_leave_request_user_status` on `(user_id, status)`
- `idx_team_membership_active` on `(is_active, user_id, team_id)`
- Additional indexes on frequently queried datetime and foreign key fields

### 2. Caching Layer Implementation

#### CacheService
Created comprehensive caching service (`core/services/cache_service.py`):

**Features:**
- User permissions caching (5 min timeout)
- Dashboard data caching (3 min timeout)  
- Team memberships caching (10 min timeout)
- System statistics caching (2 min timeout)
- Intelligent cache invalidation on data changes

**Cache Key Strategy:**
```python
def _make_cache_key(cls, *parts) -> str:
    key_string = ':'.join(str(part) for part in parts)
    if len(key_string) > 100:
        return f"tps:{hashlib.md5(key_string.encode()).hexdigest()}"
    return f"tps:{key_string}"
```

#### User Model Caching
Enhanced User model methods with caching:

```python
def is_planner(self):
    cached_permissions = CacheService.get_user_permissions(self.id)
    if cached_permissions and 'is_planner' in cached_permissions:
        return cached_permissions['is_planner']
    
    # Calculate and cache all permissions at once
    result = self.role in ['PLANNER', 'MANAGER', 'ADMIN']
    permissions = {...}
    CacheService.set_user_permissions(self.id, permissions)
    return result
```

### 3. Query Optimization Service

#### QueryOptimizationService
Created centralized service (`core/services/query_optimization_service.py`):

**Key Features:**
- `get_user_dashboard_data()` - Single optimized query for user dashboard
- `get_team_workload_stats()` - Bulk team statistics in one query
- `get_system_health_metrics()` - Comprehensive system metrics with minimal queries
- `get_user_workload_analysis()` - Detailed user workload with single query

**Example Optimization:**
```python
# Single query for user dashboard with all relationships
user_assignments = Assignment.objects.filter(user=user).select_related(
    'shift__template',
    'shift__planning_period', 
    'assigned_by'
).prefetch_related('shift__planning_period__teams')

# Aggregate all statistics in one query
assignment_stats = user_assignments.aggregate(
    total_assignments=Count('id'),
    this_week_assignments=Count('id', filter=Q(...)),
    upcoming_assignments=Count('id', filter=Q(...)),
    completed_assignments=Count('id', filter=Q(...)),
    pending_confirmations=Count('id', filter=Q(...))
)
```

### 4. Enhanced Dashboard Service

#### Optimized Strategy Pattern
Updated dashboard strategies to use new optimization services:

```python
def _get_system_metrics_optimized(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Use optimized query service instead of separate queries
    system_metrics = QueryOptimizationService.get_system_health_metrics()
    return {
        'total_users': system_metrics['total_active_users'],
        'system_health': system_metrics['success_rate'],
        'user_engagement_rate': system_metrics['user_engagement_rate'],
        # ... more metrics from single service call
    }
```

### 5. API Endpoint Caching

Enhanced API endpoints with caching:

```python
@api_view(['GET'])
def dashboard_stats(request):
    # Try cache first
    cached_response = CacheService.get_dashboard_data(
        request.user.id, f"api_{request.user.role}"
    )
    if cached_response:
        return Response(cached_response, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
    
    # Generate and cache response
    # ...
    CacheService.set_dashboard_data(request.user.id, f"api_{request.user.role}", api_response)
```

## Performance Testing

### Test Command
Created `core/management/commands/test_performance.py` for benchmarking:

**Features:**
- Dashboard loading performance tests
- Query count analysis  
- Caching effectiveness measurement
- Performance recommendations

**Usage:**
```bash
python manage.py test_performance --iterations 10 --clear-cache
```

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Big O Analysis

**Before Optimizations:**
- Dashboard loading: O(n*m) where n=teams, m=queries per team
- Leave overview: O(k) with k separate queries  
- User permission checks: O(n) with repeated calculations

**After Optimizations:**  
- Dashboard loading: O(1) with caching, O(log n) with query optimization
- Leave overview: O(1) with combined aggregated queries
- User permission checks: O(1) with caching

### Query Count Reductions

**Estimated improvements:**
- Manager dashboard: ~15-20 queries â†’ 3-5 queries
- User dashboard: ~8-12 queries â†’ 2-3 queries  
- Leave overview: ~6-8 queries â†’ 2-3 queries
- System health metrics: ~10-15 queries â†’ 1-2 queries

### Response Time Improvements

**With caching enabled:**
- Dashboard loading: 50-80% reduction in response time
- API endpoints: 60-90% reduction for cached responses
- Permission checks: 95%+ reduction (memory cache vs database)
