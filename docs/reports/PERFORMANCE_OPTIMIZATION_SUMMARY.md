# TPS Performance Optimization Summary

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations Completed

This document summarizes all performance optimizations implemented in the TPS (Team Planning System) repository to address identified bottlenecks and significantly improve system performance.

## üìä Performance Issues Identified & Resolved

### 1. Database Query Bottlenecks ‚úÖ FIXED

#### N+1 Query Problems (High Impact)
- **ManagerDashboardStrategy._get_team_stats()**: Fixed N+1 queries by implementing bulk aggregation
- **PlannerDashboardStrategy._generate_planning_advice()**: Eliminated per-team queries with single aggregated query
- **LeaveOverviewView.get_context_data()**: Combined multiple separate queries into 2 optimized aggregate operations

#### Missing Query Optimizations ‚úÖ FIXED  
- Added `select_related` and `prefetch_related` to all dashboard queries
- Implemented strategic database indexes for frequently queried fields
- Created `QueryOptimizationService` for complex database operations

### 2. Caching Bottlenecks ‚úÖ FIXED

#### No Caching Layer ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **User permissions**: Now cached for 5 minutes with intelligent invalidation
- **Dashboard data**: Cached for 3 minutes with role-based cache keys
- **Team memberships**: Cached for 10 minutes with automatic updates
- **System statistics**: Cached for 2 minutes with bulk calculations

### 3. Algorithm Inefficiencies ‚úÖ OPTIMIZED

#### Repeated Calculations ‚úÖ OPTIMIZED
- Role-based permission checks now use cached results
- Team statistics calculated in bulk rather than individually  
- Dashboard context uses optimized service layer pattern

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementations

### Database Optimizations

#### Query Optimization Service
```python
# NEW: Single optimized query for user dashboard
user_assignments = Assignment.objects.filter(user=user).select_related(
    'shift__template', 'shift__planning_period', 'assigned_by'
).prefetch_related('shift__planning_period__teams')

# Aggregate all statistics in one query  
assignment_stats = user_assignments.aggregate(
    total_assignments=Count('id'),
    this_week_assignments=Count('id', filter=Q(...)),
    upcoming_assignments=Count('id', filter=Q(...)),
    # ... more metrics
)
```

#### Database Indexes Added
- `idx_user_role` on `tps_users.role`
- `idx_assignment_status` on `tps_assignments.status`
- `idx_assignment_user_status` on `(user_id, status)`
- `idx_leave_request_user_status` on `(user_id, status)`  
- `idx_team_membership_active` on `(is_active, user_id, team_id)`
- Plus 7 additional strategic indexes

### Caching Layer Implementation

#### CacheService Features
```python
# Intelligent cache key generation
cache_key = CacheService._make_cache_key('user_permissions', user_id)

# Role-based permission caching
permissions = CacheService.get_user_permissions(user.id)
if permissions and 'is_planner' in permissions:
    return permissions['is_planner']

# Automatic cache invalidation on data changes
CacheService.invalidate_all_user_cache(user_id)
```

### Async & Lazy Loading

#### Async Views for Heavy Operations
```python
# Concurrent execution of independent queries
tasks = [
    sync_to_async(QueryOptimizationService.get_user_dashboard_data)(user),
    sync_to_async(QueryOptimizationService.get_system_health_metrics)(),
    sync_to_async(QueryOptimizationService.get_user_teams_optimized)(user.id),
]
results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
```

#### Lazy Loading Service
```python
@LazyLoadingService.lazy_property
def expensive_calculation(self):
    # Only calculated when accessed
    return self.perform_heavy_calculation()

@LazyLoadingService.paginated_lazy_loader(page_size=20)
def get_large_dataset(self):
    # Paginated loading of large results
    return self.large_queryset.all()
```
